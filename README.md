Mini Python project developed with state-of-art media pipe library. The project contains recognizing human body and spotting the main points of it, then conducting ergonomic scanning accordingly. There are 5 types of 'Danger Move' in the project that are disclosed in the scanner.py file. When a dangerous move takes place the red light pops up and the project logs the related move. This project can be a great base for further works. Enjoy!
